# Print all even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, with each number on a separate line.

# Bonus Question: Can you solve the problem by iterating over just the even numbers?


# Problem
input: range (1,100)
output: all even numbers 1-99

requirements:
print each even number on new line
follow range1-99
iterate through a range of numbers, check if even or odd
skip odd numbers
rules:
^^ same as above
mental model:
use a for loop to iterate of a range of numbers (1-99).
check each number if it is even. Print the number if it is even, skip it if odd.

# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
must not print: >=0, <=100, non ints,odd numbers
can print: negatives, even numbers

# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
for loop
if else condition
% operator to check remainder when dividied by 2 == even
continue : skip odd numbers
range(1-100)

# algorithm
for number in range(1,100) # maybe step but would need if condition to skip 1 (?)
if odd continue  (if not using step to iterate over odd...)

steps to convert input to output:
make a for loop with range 1,100, test out what happens if we use step 2
make loop body with conditon to check if odd or even
odd == continue
even == print
