# Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount 
# and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip, then print both the tip and 
# the total amount of the bill.
#  You can ignore input validation and assume that the user will enter valid numbers.

# Problem
input: 2 args: bill amount- float, tip rate-float
output: total cost : bill + tip

requirements:
take in user input: floats (dont need to stress about other types being input)
find tip amount: tip rate * bill
look up tip rates format (#%, .#, # ...)
    should just input a number only no other symbols (%)
return tip amount + total (bill/tip)

rules:
print 2 things (tip amount and total bill)
prompt for input
compute tip based on bill and tip rate

mental model:
Make a program that takes in a bill amount and tip rate. 
It should calculate tip amount aswell as the total bill.
It returns the tip amount based on the rate
 as well as the total bill amount (bill and tip combined).


# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
different tip rates (): less than 0 == no tip, 100, 120, 50, 10
not enough/ too much args input: >2 args, <2 args


# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
input variables: tip_rate & bill
function takes in 2 args
if elif else conditions 
tip variable: convert tip rate : tip_rate% * bill
total_bill variable = calc tip + bill
return tip and total bill in f string


# algorithm
steps to convert input to output:
ask for user input and store in variables: tip_rate, bill
define function that takes 2 args: tip_rate and bill
function body: 
    tip variable to calc tip_rate% * bill
    total_bill variable : tip + bill
return fstring with tip and total bill
