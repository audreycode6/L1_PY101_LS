# Print all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, with each number on a separate line.

# Bonus Question: Can you solve the problem by iterating over just the odd numbers?

# Problem
input: int --> 1/ no input really since not a function
output: all odd numbers from 1-99

requirements: 
skip even numbers, 
print each number on new line, 
1-99 (not lower or greater)
goal to iterate over just odd numbers, if even skip

rules:
^^ skip even numbers from 1-99
not necesarily a function but a loop and print
range: 1-99

mental model:
loop through a range of numbers from 1-99 and print on a new line each odd number.

# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
1 (prints), 99 (p), 0(error), 100 (error), even(continune)/ odd numbers(print), 
float/list (prob cant happen bc not function)

# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
for loop with range 1,100
print statements with \n (new line)
continue: if even (even == i % 2 =0)

# algorithm
steps to convert input to output:
1. make a for loop with range 1,100 (stops before 100 == 99)
2. body of for loop:
    condition: if even (i%2==0) continue, else print i
