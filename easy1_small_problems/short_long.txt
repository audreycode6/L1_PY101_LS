# Write a function that takes two strings as arguments, determines the length of the two strings, 
# and then returns the result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, 
# and the shorter string once again. You may assume that the strings are of different lengths.

# Problem
input: 2 args: strings 
output:return result of concatenating new string: shorterstring + longerS + shorterS

requirements: 
take in string input
determine length of 2 strings, 
identify shorter vs longer
concatenate string: short + long + short

rules:
short long short
mental model:
Take in input of 2 strings and compare them in length. 
Return a new string by concatenating the shorter string with longer string and again the shorter string.


# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
strings same length : could do error message but they said we can ignore
short strings VS long strings
strings with multiple words
strings with symbols: ' " ,!
strings with multiple spaces


# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
len() to find length of strings
variables to store string1 and string2
max() to find longer -- maybe min?
variables to store longer vs shorter
+ operator to concatenate
function + return


# algorithm
steps to convert input to output:
take in user input: 2 string args / store variables
def short_long-short() function 
compare length: len
if > == long_str
if < == short_str
concatenate: s + l + s
return
