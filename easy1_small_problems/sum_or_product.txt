# Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, 
# then asks whether the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all numbers 
# between 1 and the entered integer, inclusive.

Ex1:
Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5
Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. s
The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.

Ex2:
Please enter an integer greater than 0: 6
Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. p

The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

# Problem
input: 2 user input: int > 0, sum or product
output: sum of user int range(1, int+1) OR product of of user int range(1, int+1)

requirements:
2 user inputs: (int) and (string) 
check user input to meet requirements int  > 0 AND string == 's' or 'p'
if else condition: different actions based on string input
sum function: for num range(1, int+1) num += num
product function: for num range(1, int+1) num *= num

rules: ^^
mental model: make a function that takes in 2 user's input: 
1st a number greater than 0 and next a string identifying,
if they want 's'the sum of the int they input or 'p' the product of the int they input
return the final product.

# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
0 = error
big number = 100
wrong string input ("sum"/"product"/) = error message


# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
int(input()) = to grab first arg
input() = to grab 2nd arg
function
range(1, int+1) to loop through numbers
+= to find sum of 1-int
*= to find product of 1-int
f string to return nice format 

# algorithm
steps to convert input to output:
store args in variable with input(): number and determine
define function: 2 args (variables we made of input)
check string input is correct
if else condition is s += or p *=
return fstring answer

# code
