# Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a room, 
# in meters, then prints the room's area in both square meters and square feet.

# Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

# Problem
input:length and width of room (meters)
output: rooms area in square meters AND square feet
requirements:
take in 2 inputs from user
find area in square metters(L*W)
find area in sqaure feet == (L * 10.7639) * (W * 10.7639) 
print out areas (sf and sm)

rules:
must enter int/float as input
need 2 inputs (W and L)
do math to convert meters to feet and find sqaure feet areas

mental model:
Take in user input as number for size of length and width of room as meters.
Use length and width to find area. convert meters to ft and find area. Print area results.

# Examples/text cases
edge cases + expected output
float, int, non number input

# data structure
what will i use to convert input to output:
int(input()) OR float(input) -- prob float but good to test
 * operator to multiply meter total of L and W to conversion (1 m == 10.7639)
variables to keep track of area (meters and SF), L and W in Meter and L and W in SF
print() to return results

# algorithm
steps to convert input to output:
take in user input for L and W -- construct to float : store in variables LM WM
variables LSF WSF to store conversion of L and W to square feet
multiply L and W (meters and SF) and store results in variable/print

# code
